This is the project to predict whether there is a rock or mine. By using sonar dataset.
Imagine if there is a submarine, and the submarine was entering the other countries border. 
If the other country places some mine (Explosives) to prevent from enemy countries attack. 
In that case this prediction will be useful. As we all know submarine uses sonar waves to detect the nearby objects.
With that previous sonar datasets. Now we are going to predict whether the object is rock or mine.
